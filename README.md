  a- shelves section :
  1- Currently Reading Books : which has the books you are currently reading
  2- want to read books : which has the book you want to read
  3- read books : which has the books you already read

-has a search bar where you can search by book,author or ISBN

## How to use it

- you already has books in each section
- you can change between sections by clicking the dropdwon menu and select which section you need to put the book to
- if you refresh the page or even close the window when you come back you are going the have the updated data as all data is stored into backend server and fetch the updated data once you come again
- you can choose none from the dropdown to remove a book from the main page
- you can serach in the serach page for a book and all have state of none, once you choose to add it to the shelves you gonna have an updated state and if you come back to the main page you are going to have that book in the specific shelf
